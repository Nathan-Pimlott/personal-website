                    shows 2 different sides of development.

                    When I'm not working, I'm usually messing around with
                    personal coding projects, playing games (big Pok√©mon fan) or
                    reading manga.

                    I've also been studying Êó•Êú¨Ë™û for the last year or so with
                    the intention of being able to understand some of the anime
                    without having the subtitles turned on, which has turned out
                    to be extremely time consuming (who would have thought? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
                    I'm hoping to get over to Êó•Êú¨ sometime in the next couple
                    of years as well.
