                    worked with a variety of systems, tools and development
                    methods over the years with team sizes ranging from a 2
                    person team to several 10+ person teams. I'm glad I've had
                    the chance to work in such different teams as it really
                    shows 2 different sides of development.

                    When I'm not working, I'm usually messing around with

                    reading manga.

                    I've also been studying Êó•Êú¨Ë™û for the last year or so with
                    the intention of being able to understand some of the anime
                    without having the subtitles turned on, which has turned out
                    to be extremely time consuming (who would have thought? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).
                    I'm hoping to get over to Êó•Êú¨ sometime in the next couple
                    of years as well.
